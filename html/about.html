    </h1>About</h1>
    <p>Alleviate is a typing assistant that corrects the user’s posture to prevent carpal tunnel and tendonitis. </p>
    <p>Improper typing posture is detected by both the angle of the wrist and overextension of the digits in regard to their respective tendons. Extension is a measurement of angle and position of the digits. When the user’s wrist angle or digit extension is out of the acceptable range, the user will be notified and prompted to return to correct position through real-time feedback.  </p>
